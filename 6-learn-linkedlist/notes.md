# Why do we Need LinkedList- 

So as you know in other lang array are fixed(in js array are dynamic and can hold any value type) and insertions and deletion took o(n)
As array are stored in contiguos location
while in linkedlist insertion/deletion O(1) - so it is much faster

```js

const a = "akash"

```

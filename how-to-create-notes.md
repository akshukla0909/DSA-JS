Here’s a simple example of how you can format a **note with code**—perfect for pushing to GitHub from VS Code:

## 📝 Notes on JavaScript Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are zero-indexed and can hold different data types.

### 🔹 Creating an Array
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

### 🔹 Accessing Elements
```javascript
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple
```

### 🔹 Adding Elements
```javascript
fruits.push("orange");
```

### 🔹 Looping Through an Array
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}
```

You can write notes like this in a `.md` (Markdown) file or even a `.js` file with comments. Once saved, follow the Git steps I shared earlier to push it to GitHub.
